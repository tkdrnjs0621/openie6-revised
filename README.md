# openie6-revised
This is an revised implementation of OpenIE6: Iterative Grid Labeling and Coordination Analysis for Open Information Extraction. (EMNLP 2020)

Original implementation(https://github.com/dair-iitd/openie6) is made by the authors of the paper.

## Changes
Original Implementation is based on various libraries including pytorch lightning, and torchtext.

We removed its dependency of pytorch-lighthing and torchtext so that the revision can run on native pytorch and huggingface.

## Datasets and Metric
Datasets and Metric System(Carb) are identical with the original repository, so we do not include those on this repo.
